= jsvCard - JavaScript vCard reader and parser

== The building process

The process is based on Rake, so to proceed you should have
a Ruby installation and the Rake installed. See http://rake.rubyforge.org/

You must also have a working java installation that meets the requirements
of jslint and yuicompressor in the versions included in lib folder

The process is divided in four phases:
1. JSLint
2. Generate docs
3. Concatenate and compress the .js
4. Modify the test files

If you wish to generate the docs you should meet the requirements from
YUI Doc (see lib/yiudoc/INSTALL).

At the end of the building process you are invited to run the specs for the 
builded code.
